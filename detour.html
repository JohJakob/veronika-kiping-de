The Walz, also called Wanderjahre or Tippelei, was in the Middle Ages as a prerequisite
to gain the master's degree and to take up the guild,
an association of persons of the same estate. Handwerksgesell_
inside had to leave home for at least three years and one day
and wandering around the world to meet new masters against food
and Logis to work and learn. The wandering served as a professional,
social and personal training of the company.
<br><br>

Even today, craft tradesmen go on a hike. Since she is not
is more compulsory, the numbers of wandering people have gone far.
The Walz as a tradition is still quite mysterious, as an abuse of this
Tradition should be avoided. Knowledge is still preferred today
conveyed orally.
Since 2014, the company hike has been under the motto ‘Wissen. Können.
Weitergeben.’ (‘Knowledge. Skills. Sharing.’) to the intangible cultural heritage of Germany.
<br><br>

Even creative professions can be based on the tradition of rolling their knowledge and
Can you test and pass on in the free world? What do you need for that?
What needs to happen to use the roll as a model, but tradition
not to stand in the way?
The Walz was once an integral part of the teaching. Invert must this
System of today be adapted, especially with regard to the young
Occupational branch of design, which redefines itself over and over again? is
not just this applied, agile way of working that what integrated design
accounts?
<br><br>

I would like to test this in a self-experiment. During this time would like
I investigate if companies and agencies of this unused learning and
Exchange form open to face, whether interested in the concept of rolling for
Creative professions exist and how traditional crafts think about it. To
I would like to meet with people of different professions, students, strangers and
Locals talk, but also especially with creative people who are already on the way
were or are to figure out what their motivation and goal are behind
their journey is.
<br><br>

I would like to learn something new, leave my comfort zone and feel so
Develop designer.
For me, rolling means risk and uncertainty. But how can you do it
make it more popular and safer for future students, graduates
or professionals - not just from the design - follow this idea to get through
Walz to learn, search and find something new?
