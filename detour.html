                <p>
                    After my graduation but first I will try it out and develope a concept of
                    bringing this idea to other people with my bachelor thesis tryout:
                    <br><br>
                    I want to:<br>
                    &bull; work with you on your projects<br>
                    &bull; learn about you and your design techniques<br>
                    &bull; create a community with you
                    <br><br>
                    guidelines:<br>
                    &bull; working and learning for board and lodging (pay what you wish)<br>
                    &bull; max. about one month at one place – for the bachelor test phase<br>
                    &bull; keep a 50 km distance to my home base

                            <h3>THE IDEA</h3>
                            <p>I would like to learn something new, leave my comfort zone and develop as a designer. For
                                me,
                                the
                                journey_womans years imply risks and uncertainty. But how can it become more popular and
                                safer
                                for future students, graduates or professionals - not only designers – to follow this
                                idea
                                and
                                to learn, search and find something new through the Walz? </p>
                        </div>
                        <h3>WAIT, THE WHAT?</h3>
                        <p>In the Middle Ages the Walz (journeyman years) were mandatory for a craftsmen to continue
                            with
                            the higher level apprenticeship and to become a member of their guild, an association of
                            people
                            of the same craft. Journey_women had to leave home for at least three years and one day to
                            wander around the world and learn from different mentors by working for board and lodging.
                            The
                            tour served as a professional, social and personal training of the journey_woman.
                            <br><br>
                            Even today, craftsmen continue with this tradition. Since it is not necessary anymore, the
                            amount of journey_woman has fallen. The Walz as a tradition is still quite mysterious, as an
                            abuse of this Tradition should be avoided. Knowledge is still preferred to be communicated
                            personally. Since 2014, the jorneyman years are part of the German cultural heritage themed
                            ‘Wissen. Können. Weitergeben.’ (‘knowledge. skills. sharing.’). </p>

                        <h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
                        <p>I would like to learn something new, leave my comfort zone and develop as a designer. For me,
                            the
                            journey_womans years imply risks and uncertainty. But how can it become more popular and
                            safer
                            for future students, graduates or professionals - not only designers – to follow this idea
                            and
                            to learn, search and find something new through the Walz? </p>

                        <h3>REGARDING DESIGN</h3>
                        <p>Is it possible for creative professionals to exchange and collect knowledge and skills based
                            on
                            the tradition of the Walz? What is needed for that? What needs to happen to use the Walz as
                            a
                            model, without interfering with the craftsmans tradition? The Walz was an integral part of
                            the
                            apprenticeship in the past. How has its system to be adapted to this day and age, especially
                            with regard to the young professional field of design, which redefines itself over and over
                            again? Is not this applied, an agile way of working representative of integrated design?
                            <br><br>
                            I would like to test this in a self-experiment. During this time I would like to investigate
                            wether companies and agencies are open minded about this unused learning and exchange form,
                            whether there is interest towards the concept of the Walz for Creative professions and how
                            people of the traditional crafts think about it. Considering that I would like to meet up
                            with
                            people of different professions, students, strangers and locals - but especially with
                            creative
                            people who are already (or have been) on the Walz - to figure out what their motivation and
                            goal
                            behind their journey is.

                        <h3>TBIRTH OF IDEA</h3>
                        <p>I had the idea of going on a Walz after my graduation when I visited Bamberg in autumn 2018
                            when a friend told me about this tradition. In Bamberg many stonesmiths meet up to do
                            something.
                            Since the design craft is a craft also, I thoight it would be useful to transfer the
                            tradition to it. Since I never really know where my life is headed I was really euphorical
                            of the Idea to continue learning end exploring, to develop further as designer and human
                            beeing.
                            I was passionate about the walz but not about my upcoming thesis because I found it
                            difficult to find a topic I liked so I combined the two things.
