                a design experiment
                <p>
                    wattwurm design is a self initiated project in which I want to experiment with the time for a
                    design. I
                    want to evaluate whether it is visible that a design was created in one day, one month or half a
                    year.
                    In november 2018 the idea was born when I wondered why I always got scared of projects I had to do
                    in my studies,
                    especially finishing or sticking to them. This experiment moght help me to create some
                    techniques to structure my work or to realize how I work most efficient and fun.
                    <br><br>
                    The first attempt is to create a design in 24 hours from two random things &ndash; a need and an
                    adjective.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently I keep myself busy with my thesis project &ndash; which is <a href="detour.html">this</a>
                    'sticky' project &ndash; but I will
                    continue when I need a break.
